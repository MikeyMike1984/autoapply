Job Application Automation & Resume Customization System Overview
After analyzing the provided conversations and repository code, I can outline the application's purpose, architecture, and agreed-upon strategies for development.
Application Purpose & Goals
This system aims to:

Extract job listings from multiple job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, Glassdoor, Google)
Store job data in MongoDB (shifted from initial Google Sheets approach)
Analyze job descriptions to extract requirements and match them with user's professional experience
Generate custom-tailored resumes that maintain pixel-perfect formatting consistency
Automatically apply to jobs using platform-specific application flows
Operate with minimal user oversight through high reliability and trust

System Architecture
A component-based architecture has been agreed upon:

Agreed Tools & Strategies

Technology Stack:

Language: Python 3.10+
Database: MongoDB (replacing Google Sheets for scalability)
Browser Automation: Playwright (replacing Selenium for better stealth)
LLM for Resume Generation: Initially using local LLM (ollama with mistral:instruct model)
PDF Generation: ReportLab for pixel-perfect formatting


Resume Generation Approach:

Template-based approach with consistent formatting
Extract formatting from user's existing resume
Structured prompts for LLM with few-shot examples
JSON response format for structured data


Development Strategy:

Provider-agnostic LLM interface
Event-driven communication between components
Progressive enhancement (phase-by-phase implementation)
State machine approach for application flows


Database Model:

Jobs collection (with platform data, analysis, and status)
Resumes collection (with files and customization data)
Professional profiles collection (detailed user experience)
Application history collection (application process data)


Implementation Priorities:

Start with the Scraper Module
Implement resume generation with local LLM (mistral:instruct)
Focus on formatting consistency for generated resumes
Create application automation component



Key Technical Decisions

LLM Implementation:

Use local models (mistral:instruct) for development
Abstract LLM interface for potential future migration to cloud providers


PDF Generation:

Use ReportLab for pixel-perfect control over layout and formatting
Parse existing resume format to maintain visual consistency


Application Architecture:

RESTful APIs for component communication
Event-driven design for asynchronous processing
Circuit breaker pattern for error handling


Security & Anti-Detection:

Implement human-like interaction patterns
Rate limiting with exponential backoff
Secure credential storage



The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable with clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces between components.
